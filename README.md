# arcadia-roguelike
<strong>The Unity Roguelike tutorial implemented in Clojure Arcadia.<strong>

Currently a work in progress but should be completed soon!

Be sure to clone the <a href="https://github.com/arcadia-unity/Arcadia">arcadia repo</a> into Assets/Arcadia before attempting to use the project.

Hopefully a well written tutorial/guide is on the way!

<h3>Enjoy!</h3>
